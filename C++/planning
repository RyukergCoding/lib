want a directory structure of includes, but use it sparingly
Header only libraries
.../Math
.../DataStructures
.../Algorithms
.../etc
These can be fluid but try not to make it excessively so/give updates on git
in a standard place
may need to hard theorycraft any library I'd need ever
How to make this easily transportable to schoolwork
/test do work and coding in here
/submit dir for final submission
/.bashrc aliasing probably
g++ -std=c++{vrsn#} -I$HOME/lib/C++/{vrsn#} in make files for g++{vrsn#}
each header should have multiple versions with identical unit tests
Try to not conflict or multiple namespaces will ensue, which is hard to 
remember
Point of these libraries is to provide standard interfaces to 
the most efficient implementation at the time.
